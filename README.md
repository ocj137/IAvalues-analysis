# IAvalues-analysis

In the "IAValues" dataset, there are a number of missing (null) values for the rootznaws column, which measures root zone available water storage. The goal of this project is to create a simple model to predict those missing values. Load the dataset and perform and appropriate inspection of the data to verify that it is suitable for building a model.

I will build a model to predict the value of rootznaws.  I use the model to predict the missing values of rootznaws.
